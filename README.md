# Simple_production_planning
VBA macro creating a production plan using a table with products and orders.

This macro uses a table with products on one axis and orders on the other. It then stores the combined quantities of each product to be made and uses additional methods to create the production plan. In this version, the method used is a simple sorting algorithm that selects the product with the largest number of pieces and sets it up for production.
